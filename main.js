let mName = "Rakib";

    console.log(email,"is a invalid email");
}

// 5. Question: Write a JavaScript program that checks whether a given number is divisible by 10. The program should print a message indicating whether the number is divisible by 10 or not.

let first = 10; 
let second = 5;

if ((first % second) == 0) {
    console.log("Is divisible by 10");}else
     {
    console.log("Is not divisible by 10");
}

// 6. Question: Write a JavaScript program that checks whether a given number is even or odd. The program should print a message indicating whether the number is even or odd.

const isEven = 20;

if(isEven % 2 == 0) {
    console.log("The number is even.");
}
else {
    console.log("The number is odd.");
}

// 7. Write a JavaScript program that checks whether a given character is a string or a number. The program should print a message indicating whether the given variable is a string or number. 

let test = "Hi i am Rakib Hasan";
